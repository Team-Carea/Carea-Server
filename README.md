**Carea** is an app designed for care leavers, offering a platform where individuals can share information, life stories, and forge connections with peers within the community. 
Additionally, users have the opportunity of connections with nearby adults who can provide valuable insights and guidance on navigating life's challenges.

## ✨ **Introduction**
After the TV show of "Grocery Butlers" in Korea, there was an explosive surge in public interest. 
The government and numerous companies provided welfare services and financial assistance to support them.

However, many still lack information about the society they have to face, and even worse, they grapple with intense loneliness.
They trapped in these blind spots need opportunities to connect with peers in similar situations, share experiences, and if necessary, meet caring adults who can guide their future. 
This is why we conceived **"Carea"**.
